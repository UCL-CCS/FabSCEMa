# How to run a SCEMa (test) Job

These examples assume that you have been able to run the basic FabSim examples described in the other documentation files, and that you have built and configured SCEMa (https://github.com/UCL-CCS/SCEMa) on the target machine.

Two minimal examples of  SCEMa simulation are provided in ``config_files/SCEMa_test1`` and  ``config_files/SCEMa_test2`` to execute these examples type:

``fabsim localhost SCEMa:SCEMa_test1``

``fabsim localhost SCEMa:SCEMa_test2``
