# The system is polyethane, using the CVFF forcefield

##  Triclinic box: the current box generated from the above data file
##  'PE.lammps05' is an orthogonal box. It is necessary to force switch to
##  triclinic box so the box can be tilted when applying deformation (fix deform),
##  applying pressure (fix npt), or minimizing energy (fix box/relax).
##  This might only be necessary in the initial preparation of the reference
##  simulation box (when minimization and heatup/cooldown will be applied). For
##  the later simulations, restart command will automatically generate triclinic
##  box from the previous simulations.
